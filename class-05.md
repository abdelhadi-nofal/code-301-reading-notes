## What is Heroku?

 Heroku is a cloud service platform whose popularity has grown in recent years. Heroku is so easy to use that it’s a top choice for many development projects.

 With a special focus on supporting customer-focused apps, it enables simple application development and deployment. Since the Heroku platform manages hardware and servers, businesses that use Heroku are able to focus on perfecting their apps. And not the infrastructure that supports them.

 More time goes towards ensuring that users receive the highest quality experiences as possible.


### Where Heroku Fits into Cloud Computing

Heroku, a Platform-as-as-Service solution, is generally easy-to-use. But it’s most beneficial to businesses in specific situations.
Heroku has a free service model for small projects. Also, tiered service packages exist for cases where more complex business needs must be addressed.


### What is Heroku Used For?

The Heroku cloud service platform is based on a managed container (called dynos within the Heroku paradigm) system.
It has integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem for deploying and running modern applications.

### Heroku Accommodates Many Development Languages

Heroku supports several programming languages that are used as a web application deployment model. As one of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007. Back then,
it supported only the Ruby programming language.
But now it also supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.
This means a variety of developers can look to Heroku for an inexpensive way to scale their application, no matter their preferred development language.

### Heroku Supports Diverse Solutions

Heroku also provides custom buildpacks, where developers can deploy apps in any other programming language. For this reason,
Heroku is a polyglot platform. It lets the developer build, run, and scale applications in a similar manner across all programming languages.
Polymorphism and scalability are reasons why Heroku is often seen as a preferred platform amongst developers.

### Heroku Dynos Enable Easy Development and Better Usability

Applications that are run on Heroku typically have unique domain names, which are used to route HTTP requests to the correct container.
Applications as services use application containers. Containers are designed to package and run services.
Each of the application containers is а smart container on a reliable, fully-managed runtime environment.
Application containers — referred to as “dynos” in the context of the Heroku platform — are spread across a “dyno grid.” This consists of several servers.
The Dyno manager maintains and operates the created dynos.
All this means is that since Heroku manages and runs applications, there’s no need to manage operating systems or other internal system configurations.

### Heroku Lets Developers Scale Applications Instantly

This is accomplished either by increasing the number of dynos or by changing the type of dyno in which the app runs.
When the application can scale so easily, the user can always expect more speed when using that application.
The simple way to scale applications makes working with Heroku easy and convenient.
Projects created in Heroku are bound to repositories in GitHub.
Heroku’s integration with GitHub provides automated builds and deploys of the latest version of code.

GitHub is a trusted repository of source code, so Heroku’s integration with GitHub and other tools helps developers optimize their efforts
and save stakeholders time and money over the course of development projects.
